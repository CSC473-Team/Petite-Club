The target audience is women who wear petite size clothing. Women who wear petite
clothes have more stress to make their choice of the outfit in order not to look smaller. Because

internet businesses that deliver a box of styled outfit in petite size with professional stylists'
choices to the customer's front door. Why would you let AI generate styled outfits for users and
save their money?
